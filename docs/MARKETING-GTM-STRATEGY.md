Title: I built an AI to help new Muslims learn Islam - would love feedback

Hey everyone! As-salamu alaykum.

I've been working on a project for the past year to help new Muslims
(and anyone learning Islam) have a more structured learning experience.

The Problem I Saw:
- New Muslims often feel overwhelmed
- Traditional Islamic education requires in-person classes
- Online resources are scattered and sometimes unreliable

What I Built:
An AI trained on Quran, authenticated Hadith, and classical Islamic texts
that can answer questions with proper sources.

Example Questions It Can Answer:
- "What are the conditions for valid wudu?" [Shows sources]
- "Explain the difference between Hanafi and Shafi'i prayer positions"
- "How do I calculate Zakat on my savings?"

It also has Quran reading, Arabic learning, and prayer time features.

I'd love feedback from this community:
1. What concerns do you have about AI for Islamic education?
2. What would make you trust an AI's Islamic answers?
3. What features would you want to see?

Link in my profile if you want to try it (launching publicly next week).

Jazakallah khair!
```

**Post Timing:**
- Best time: 8-10 AM EST (when users browse at work)
- Engage with comments for first 2 hours
