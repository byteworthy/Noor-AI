## 1. Support Philosophy {#philosophy}

### Core Principles

**1. Empathy First**
- Users are learning Islam/Arabic - be patient and encouraging
- Never dismiss concerns, even if they seem minor
- Assume positive intent

**2. Speed + Quality**
- Quick acknowledgment (within 4 hours)
- Thoughtful resolution (within 24 hours)
- Better to take time than give wrong Islamic info

**3. Education > Transactions**
- Teach users how to use features
- Link to help articles
- Turn support into learning moments

**4. Scholar Oversight for Religious Questions**
- Never provide fatwa/religious rulings yourself
- Escalate to advisory scholars
- Always include disclaimer

### Support Team Structure

**Phase 1 (Launch - phase): Solo Founder**
- You handle all support initially
- Use templates and automation
- Target: 50-100 tickets/week

**Phase 2 (development phase): Hire Part-Time Support**
- 1 part-time support specialist (20 hrs/week)
- You handle religious questions
- Target: 200-500 tickets/week

**Phase 3 (phase+): Full Support Team**
